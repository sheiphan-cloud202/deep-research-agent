        Each use case must include:
        - A **verbose, well-explained description** that clearly articulates the problem, context, and proposed innovation in 4â€“6 sentences.
        - A **concise and specific business value** statement highlighting the potential ROI, efficiency, cost savings, or strategic benefit.
        - A list of **technical requirements** including tools, models, APIs, data pipelines, or infrastructure components.
        - Clearly marked **priority** (High, Medium, or Low).
        - Assigned **complexity** (Low, Medium, or High) based on implementation effort.
        - **Citations or references** (URLs, research, or inspiration sources if available).
        - List of **AWS services** involved (e.g., SageMaker, Lambda, DynamoDB).
        - A brief but clear **implementation approach** explaining how the use case would be developed end-to-end.
        - An **estimated timeline** for development (e.g., "6 months").
        - A **monthly cost estimate** (e.g., "$50k/month").
        - A note on the **current state** of implementation (e.g., MVP exists, not implemented, partially deployed).
        - A clear **proposed solution** summarizing how this use case will be delivered and what it will solve.

        - Avoid placeholders like "TBD" or "N/A" unless truly required.
        - If feedback is given, revise use cases to reflect it.
